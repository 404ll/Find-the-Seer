# 🪄 Find-the-Seer

**[中文](README.md)** | **English**

### *There are no real prophets — only collective judgment.*

## 🌍 Overview

**Find-the-Seer** is a decentralized prediction playground built on **Sui** and **Walrus**, where **no one is a real prophet**.
Instead of depending on truth verification or oracle data, the platform relies purely on **human perception and crowd reasoning**.

Participants make and vote on “prediction posts” — statements about the future, ranging from real-world events (like the weather or sports) to social trends or fun speculations.
When time runs out, the outcome isn’t verified by an oracle — instead, it’s judged by **how closely the final voting ratio matches the poster’s initial prediction ratio**.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Post a Prediction**

   * A user (“the poster”) publishes a prophecy post with text and an optional image.
   * Each post is stored on **Walrus decentralized storage**.
   * The poster must set:

     * A **resolution time** (when the prophecy will “end”)
     * A **truth ratio** (e.g., 70% true / 30% false) — their belief in the prediction
   * Posting costs a small **SUI fee**.

2. **Vote & Stake**

   * Other users discover predictions **2 days before** their resolution time.
   * Each voter chooses “True” or “False” and stakes **0.1 SUI**.

3. **Resolution & Rewards**

   * When the prophecy expires, the final “True/False” ratio is revealed.
   * Rewards are distributed based on:

     * **How close the final ratio is to the poster’s predicted ratio** (poster reward)
     * **Voting accuracy** (voters who aligned with the final ratio are rewarded)
   * Incorrect voters lose part of their stake, which goes to the winners.

4. **Influence System**

   * A poster’s **Influence Score** grows with the total participation in their posts.
   * High-influence posters receive periodic SUI rewards from the platform pool.

## 💰 Platform Economy

**Revenue Model:**

* A small posting fee (e.g., 0.1 SUI) from each new prediction.
* 2–5% commission on staking pools for each resolved post.
* Optional NFT or badge sales for high-influence users.

**Reward Distribution:**

* 70% → Player rewards (voters + poster)
* 25% → Platform sustainability pool
* 5% → Treasury / future ecosystem development

## 🎯 Core Idea

> “There are no real prophets — only collective judgment.”

Find-the-Seer transforms *prophecy* into a **social consensus game**,
where **belief, timing, and perception** become a new form of market play.
It’s not about predicting the truth — it’s about predicting what *others* will think the truth is.

## 🚀 Future Vision

* Add “Trend Rooms” for themed predictions (e.g., sports, crypto, memes)
* Dynamic NFT reputation for posters

> 🧭 *A world without prophets — only perceptions.*
> 🌫️ *没有真正的预言家，只有众人的认知。*
